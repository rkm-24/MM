                <h2>About Madanpur Family</h2>
                <p>
                    Madanpur has had a glorious past and the Mathurs of 
                this erstwhile 'estate' have been instrumental in 
                maintaining and preserving the valuable traditions 
                of their forefathers. Madanpur family commonly
                called as (Madanpur key Mathur in Hindi i.e. 
                Mathurs of Madanpur) has registered its 
                ownership with Thakur Shree Raj Gopalji Maharaj and 
                kept its roots and structure strong. Our Forefathers 
                gave us the temple and address which has been our flagship 
                and identity at all times. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    The bonding of our 'khandaan' is reflected  when the family 
                 congregates to rejoice the 'mela' of Shree Raj 
                 Gopalji Maharaj, annually during the auspicious month 'Chaitra' 
                 of Hindu calendar. This khandaan is enriched by enthusiasm, 
                 energy and spark of youth, where the experience and wisdom of 
                 elders has keept alive its traditions, celebrations, temple customs 
                 and culture as heritage.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Sharing is caring, when we as family share memories, narrate 
                 amusing anecdotes, meet and greet with enthusiasm for celebrating 
                 and taking pride in the achievements of our extended family, the Madanpur 
                 khandaan. To be a member of Madanpur family is a blessing like sunshine
                    in winter morning. Formality which contracts conversations to 
                    monosyllables is not there when Madanpur stirs a million chords,
                    vibrant laughters being with the family and relatives devoid of any 
                    divide of status, position, power etc. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This buoyancy of togetherness at Madanpur 'mela' has kept the family bonds strong.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                </p>

                <h2>Digital Presence</h2>
                <p>
                    Global presence is the reality of today's world, yet a need to 
                    remain rooted and connected is required for self-esteem. Our talents, 
                    expertise, forums, culture, ethics 
                    can be integrated/associated with a digital presence and connectivity.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We know anecdotes of our family, our parents and grand-parents had resided at 
                    Madanpur and most of them shifted to Shikohabad or other nearby areas. 
                    They narrated and we heard them and a nostalgic fragrance remains with us 
                    throughout the life. Some relatives and names are familiar but exact 
                    connection is not clear as in the drift with the tides of time the bonding 
                    could not be sustained in so many cases.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We need the keys to open the doors which seem to have closed 
                    with time due to several issues like distances from Madanpur 
                    (our roots) due to work, busy life, travel difficulties or 
                    similar reasons. There is a strong need to re-establish the lost ties and bring families 
                    together again on a common platform improving relations through 
                    communication. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is said <span> “If there is a will, there is a way.”</span>This digital platform is to draw together
                    our family. Various activities have been added to generate interest of all age groups and we
                    remain open to add many more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Making a website is an outcome of this thought. The name of website is 
                    kept keeping our ancestors and khandaan in mind and to align it with 
                    family tree in some way. (family tree will be added soon)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>How we got this idea?</h2>
                    <p>

                        Most of us are already using various social media available today. 
                        This website will connect close relatives of Madanpur family.
                        This will add many in the family and with everyone's cooperation it will become
                        our main forum to interact and link with the family. This thought inspired us to 
                        create this website when our family members make and develop this 
                        family website our private information (data) will remain safe within 
                        the family.
                        <br>
                        <br>                     
                    </p>
                    <h2>What is the road ahead?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We have a plan to introduce a dynamic online 
                        family tree to be updated by the registered members 
                        and understand the links and relations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The website should involve and include ideas of all 
                        ages to make this site interesting. This website will 
                        be the place for members to introduce themselves and 
                        form groups as per their talents, hobbies, creative 
                        skills, achievements. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        There may be competitions, quiz and other engaging 
                        activities in future based on the request of members.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So the forum is open for members and sky is the limit 
                        for the vision.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Our Teams</h2>
                    <p>
